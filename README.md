```
from awesome_kreport_charts.models.command import CommandSet
from awesome_kreport_charts.utils.file_processor import KreportProcessor
from awesome_kreport_charts.charts.sankey_chart import SankeyChart
from awesome_kreport_charts.charts.sunburst_chart import SunBurstChart


commands = CommandSet(kreport_file='sample_files/sample.kreport',
                      domain=None,
                      excluded_nodes=[],
                      min_viruses=1,
                      min_bacteria=100,
                      min_archaea=1,
                      min_eukarya=1,
                      min_level='S',
                      chart_type='sankey',
                      output_path='sample_files/sample.html')

kreport_processor = KreportProcessor(commands)
kreport_processor.process_kreport()

if commands.chart_type == 'sankey':
    chart = SankeyChart(kreport_processor.kreport, commands)
if commands.chart_type == 'sunburst':
    chart = SunBurstChart(kreport_processor.kreport, commands)
chart.plot()
```
